== Overview
Fineract is a headless core banking platform meaning it does not have a UI. It is fully API driven whereby all operations are carried out by making API calls and getting a response.

the Mifos UI generally works with Fineract but may not fully support all apache fineract features.

The platform supports most of the standard banking operations: client management, account management, loans, accounting, short/long term deposits and reporting.

== Prerequisite configurations
Before using fineract, a number of configurations have to be completed. These include:

=== Offices
Use this feature to setup the organization office hierarchy that represents the physical office structure. By default, the head office will be available. The platform supports children of children hierarchy, for example: Head office/Regional office/Sub region office/Office/Field office

Customers and users must be tagged to an office. 

User access can be limited to an office with the user having access to the office they have been tagged to and all offices below.

For digital banks, the head office should suffice.

=== Currency
Use this feature to add currenc(ies). All products and fees require a currency to be tagged as the operating currency. Please note, each product/charge only supports one currency.

The platform does not support forex operations. Currency conversions have to be handled externally.

=== Employees 
Empployees are optionally tagged to customers, loans, savings and deposit accounts . They are also tagged(mandantory) in the teller module.

=== Payment types
Payment types are used to track the channel through which a payment was made. It can be useful for reconciliation and auditing purposes.

When used with accounting module, the payment type is linked to a GL account and determines the account debited or credited when the payment type is used in a transaction.

=== Roles and permissions
Fineract supports fine grained permission setup with each activity requiring a permission to execute.

Users are assigned role(s). Permissions are granted to roles.

=== Manage codes
Fields that require options such as client gender, address type and so on are created and maintained using the manage codes feature.
